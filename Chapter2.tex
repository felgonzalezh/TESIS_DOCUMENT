The CMS and ATLAS experiments are the biggest multi-purpose particle detectors
ever built in the world and  are part of the LHC \cite{chp2:LHCTDR}. The LHC is a 
proton collider located at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland. The 
unprecedented \centermassenergy~of the proton-proton collisions 
produced by this accelerator and its very high luminosity, make possible the search
for physics BSM in a new kinematic regime. The data used for this dissertation comes from
pp collisions produced by the LHC at \sqrts 13 TeV, and recorded by the CMS experiment during 2016.
In the present Chapter, the LHC accelerator and the CMS experiment will be
described, making emphasis on the CMS subdetectors involved in the 
tau-lepton detection, which plays an important role in this work.

\section{LHC Accelerator}
\label{sec:LHC}
The LHC is a particle accelerator designed to collide protons (or lead ions) at 
a \centermassenergy~up to 14 TeV. The LHC accelerates protons along 
two rings with a circumference of 27 km, installed in a tunnel 
approximately 100 m underground. Bunches of protons (or ions)
are accelerated in opposite directions using ratio frequency (RF) cavities along the rings. They 
collide in four different points, where dedicated experiments are placed 
in order to detect the products of the collisions. The four experiments
are: CMS \cite{chp2:CMSTDR,chp2:CMSTDR2}, 
ATLAS \cite{chp2:ATLASTDR}, LHCb \cite{chp2:LHCb} and  ALICE \cite{chp2:ALICETDR} (See Figure \ref{figchp2:LHCringsfigure}). CMS 
and ATLAS are multi-purpose detectors, optimized for the discovery of new physics BSM. The aim of the LHCb detector is to study 
the charge-parity (CP) symmetry violation, which is been postulated to explain the origin of matter-antimatter 
asymmetry in our universe. ALICE is specialized in studying the quark-gluon plasma. Besides these experiments, there 
are two additional smaller ones: TOTEM and LHCf. The TOTEM main goal is accurate measurement of total, elastic and diffractive pp
cross sections. LHCf uses the particles emitted forward by collisions in order to simulate
the cosmic rays behavior in controlled conditions.

\subsection{LHC Pronton Accelerator Chain}
\label{subsec:ProtonAcceleratorChain}

%at an energy of 450 GeV, they have several
In order to achieve the very high energy of the LHC proton beams, several
pre-acceleration stages are used as shown in Figure \ref{figchp2:LHCaccelerationchain}. Before 
protons are injected into the two LHC rings, the process starts 
with the extraction of protons in the \textit{Duoplasmatron 
Proton Ion Source}; in this source, the protons are extracted in ``\textit{bunches}'' 
by ionization of hydrogen gas. Then, these bunches are 
injected into a linear accelerator, \textit{Linac2}, where 
their energy is increased up to 50 MeV. Once the protons 
reach such energy, they are delivered to the 
\textit{Proton Synchrotron Booster} (PSB) and then to the \textit{Proton Synchrotron} (PS) 
where they are accelerated up to 1.4 GeV and 25 GeV, respectively. Additionally,
in the PS the bunches are spaced in time by 25 ns\footnote{The time spacing between 
bunches is known as \textit{Bunch Crossing} (BX). For the LHC Run I, the BX was 50 ns; for Run II 
the BX was reduced to its design value of 25 ns}. The pre-acceleration chain 
finishes in the \textit{Super Proton Synchrotron} (SPS), where the protons reach 
an energy up to 450 GeV, and then they are injected into the LHC rings. The bunches are 
injected into the LHC rings in opposite directions where they reach an 
energy up to 7 TeV per beam; i.e. the LHC could produce proton-proton collisions 
up to 14 TeV in the center-mass frame (\sqrts 14 TeV). The protons are accelerated 
using 8 RF cavities, which operate with a frequency 
that goes up to 400 MHz in the final acceleration stage and an electric field 
gradient of 5 MV per meter. The RFs also ensure the longitudinal stability of the beams. The 
proton bunches are radially focused by 392 quadrupole magnets placed along the 
LHC rings. The radial focusing is important to increase the collision probability. Additionally, the 
LHC uses 1232 superconductor dipole magnets, where each of them produce a magnetic field strength 
up to 8.3 T, in order to bend the beam along the circular path. The dipoles 
are cooled by superfluid helium at a temperature of 1.9 K, that also helps to improve the vacuum
inside the beam pipes.

\subsection{LHC Operational Parameters}
\label{sec:LHCparameters}

The main quantities that describe the performance of a particle accelerator are the beam energy and 
the luminosity. The instantaneous luminosity measures the number of collisions per unit of area 
and per unit of time \footnote{The units of instantaneous luminosity are 
cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$}; it depends on the accelerator's design and, in the 
case of the LHC, it is given by:

\begin{equation}
 L = \frac{N_{b}^{2}k_{b}f_{rev}\gamma}{4 \pi \epsilon \beta^{*}}R\quad,
\end{equation}

where $N_{b}$ is the number of protons per bunch, $k_{b}$ is the number of bunches per beam, $f_{rev}$
is the number of revolutions per second, $\gamma$ is the relativistic factor, $\epsilon$ is the 
normalized transverse beam emittance, $\beta^{*}$ is the optical $\beta$-function at the
collision point and $R$ is a
geometrical factor related with the crossing angle of the two beams. The optimization of 
the instantaneous luminosity is achieved in several ways, such as by increasing the number
of protons per bunch ($N_{b}$) or by increasing the number of bunches per beam ($k_{b}$). For the statistical accuracy 
of the physics measurements, the important quantity is the integrated luminosity \footnote{The units of the 
integrated luminosity are inverse barn, $b^{-1}$} (instantaneous luminosity integrated in time) because the number of events 
produced ($N_{eve}$) is proportional to it, and it is given by the expression:

\begin{equation}
 N_{eve} = L \sigma_{p}\quad,
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{p}$ is the cross-section of the process of interest,
for example the cross-section of an hypothetical \Zprime~production, 
$\sigma(pp \rightarrow Z^{\prime})$. If the cross-section that
we want to measure is small, we need a large integrated luminosity
in order to achieved a reasonable number of events. Even more, if the process
demands for a complex discrimination between signal and background. For instance, a 
\Zprime~decaying into two taus should have a cross-section of the order of pb, while 
Drell-Yan process, that constitute an important background, has a 
cross-section of around 5780 pb \footnote{In this example, the cross-sections
are estimated for pp collisions at \sqrts 13 TeV and for a \Zprime~with a mass of 500 GeV}.
Therefore, the signal discrimination in this cas should be of the order of 10$^{-3}$,
demanding even higher luminosities. Even more, in each BX there are several pp
 collisions (of the order of 20, during 2016 data taking period). Only a very small 
 fraction of these collisions correspond to hard proton-proton interactions that could produce
 interesting physics. Most of the collisions correspond to elastic and diffractive scattering
 as well as soft scattering. This means that in a BX with an interesting hard 
 scattering collision there would be another 20 soft scattering ones, that will have to be 
 identified and remove from the event. This phenomenum is known as “pile-up” 
 (PU) and makes difficult the identification of the hard interaction. The level 
 of PU depends on the number of protons per bunch $N_{b}$, as well as on the geometrical 
 factors of the beam. \\
 
 In order to achieve the high statistics for the identification of BSM signals, a good performance 
 of the LHC accelerator. Operational quantities such as beam energy, luminosity, bunch crossing and etc., 
 have been improved in from one running period to the next. Table \ref{chp2:LHCtable}
 shows the most relevant quantities of the LHC operation per year.

\subsubsection{Run I and Run II of the LHC}

The LHC operational period spanning from 2010 to 2012 is known as Run I. During 2010, the LHC 
reached pp collisions at \centermassenergy~of 7 TeV and an integrated luminosity of around 
50 pb$^{-1}$. During 2011 with the same \centermassenergy, an integrated luminosity of approximately 
6 fb$^{-1}$ was obtained. For the 2012 run, the energy per beam was increased 
up to 4 TeV (\sqrts 8 TeV), reaching approximately 20 fb$^{-1}$. The integrated luminosity delivered 
by the LHC and recorded by CMS during Run I is shown in Figure \ref{figchp2:luminosityRunI}. Afterwards, a two-years
technical shut-down took place. \\

      in Run I at the LHC. Taken from \cite{chp2:LHCluminosity}}
     \label{figchp2:luminosityRunI}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

After the shut-down, a new data taking period, known as Run II, started from May 
2015. That year, LHC delivered 4.2 fb$^{-1}$ of pp collisions at \sqrts~13 TeV. During 2016, LHC 
operated at the same \centermassenergy~than during 2015 and reached 40.82 fb$^{-1}$, exceeding  in 53$\%$ the expected integrated 
luminosity ($\sim$26 fb$^{-1}$). The integrated luminosity delivered by the LHC and recorded by CMS, 
during 2015 and 2016, is shown in Figure \ref{figchp2:luminosityRunII}. The success of the 2016 run was due to
the LHC operational stability and the high peak luminosity reached (1.4$\times10^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which represented 
an improvement of 40$\%$ over the design value); this was achieved due to 
the shortening of the beam size from the injectors and the reduction of the 
crossing angle between the two beams. Compared with the 2015 run the 2016 run 
reduced the number of protons per bunch to 1.1$\times10^{11}$ and the number of bunches per beam 
from 2244 to 2200, keeping the BX at 25 ns. As a result, the average
PU went from 14 in the 2015 run to 27 for the 2016 run (See \ref{chp2:LHCtable}). As already mentioned, 
the data used for this dissertation is the one recorded by CMS during 2016 run.

\section{The CMS Detector}
\label{sec:CMS}

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is, along with ATLAS, a multi-purpose detector designed 
with a broad physics program, which includes the understanding of the 
electroweak symmetry breaking through the Higgs mechanism, 
and the search for physics BSM, such as SUSY, extra dimensions, etc. The CMS 
detector is located 100 m underground in ``\textit{Point 5}'' of the 
LHC (see Figure \ref{figchp2:LHCringsfigure}). It is a hermetic detector around the collision
point, with a cylindrical shape that has a length of 21.6 m and a diameter of 14.6 m. One of 
the especial features of the detector is the superconducting solenoid which produces an inner magnetic field 
of $3.8$ T (over a volume of VOLUME m$^{3}$). The strong magnetic field bends the tracks 
of the charged particles coming from the interactions, with the purpose of identifying their 
electric charge and to accurately measure their momentum. Besides the solenoid, the detector 
is composed by four subsystems: encased inside the solenoid are the Tracker System, the 
Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) and the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL); and outside the 
magnet are the Muon Chambers. The purpose of the Silicon Tracker is to reconstruct 
the collision vertices and the tracks of the charged particles emerging from the 
collision. The Calorimeter system (ECAL and HCAL) allows to measure the energy of hadrons, electrons and 
photons. The Muon Chambers, embedded inside an iron-yoke structure, reconstruct the 
muon tracks and provide an accurate information for their momentum measurement. The overall layout of CMS detector is shown 
in Figure \ref{figchp2:CMSdetectorfigure}. A more detailed description can be found in Ref.~\cite{chp2:CMS}.

%The high collision rate that the LHC produces makes the data storage impossible 
%with the current technology. In consequence, CMS uses a Trigger System to select 
%only the hard scattering events, which are the most likely to have some interesting 
%physics. From 40 million collision per second produced by the LHC, the Trigger 
%System selects and stores only 100 events per second. \\

%and therefore, just the interesting data 
%is stored to be analyzed afterward.\\

%CMS is divided into divided into a barrel (central region) and two endcaps.
%In order to locate in space not only the detector components but also the reconstructed

In order to define the position of any detector components and, in consequence,
of any particle signal, CMS has defined a Cartesian and spherical 
coordinate systems. The origin of both systems is the interaction point, which is at the center
of the detector. The x-axis points towards the center of the LHC ring,
the y-axis points upwards and the z-axis points along the beam pipe in the
counterclockwise direction. The polar angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ are defined 
in the usualway. \\

In order to parametrize the direction in which the particles are emitted,
the pseudorapidity $\eta$ is better than $\theta$ because its distribution
is more uniform. Pseudorapidity is given by:

%instead of $\theta$

A more detailed description of the CMS coordinate system can be 
found in Ref.~\cite{chp2:CMS}. 

\section{Superconducting Solenoid}
\label{sec:Solenoid}

The superconducting solenoid produces a uniform inner magnetic 
field with the value of 3.8 T. In the outer region, the 
returning magnetic flux is compactified by the iron yoke, resulting 
on an average magnetic field strength of 2 T. The magnetic field 
provided by the solenoid bends the tracks of the charged particles 
emerging from the collisions (See Figure \ref{figchp2:CMStrajectories}) which is crucial
for their charge identification and their momentum measurement. The electric charge 
is identified according to the direction of the
bending in the magnetic field. The momentum of a charged particle 
that moves through a uniform magnetic field is given by:

\begin{equation}
p = \gamma m v = qBr\quad, 
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ is the relativistic factor; $m$, $v$, $q$ are its mass,
rapidity and charge, respectively; $B$ is the magnetic field strength; and $r$ is the ratio 
of the bending. A strong magnetic field is necessary for the momentum 
measurement of very energetic charged particles, in consequence the momentum resolution 
depends on the magnetic field strength and the spacial resolution of the detectors 
that reconstruct the tracks. The momentum resolution is:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\sigma_{p}}{p} \propto \frac{p}{BL^{2}}\quad,
\end{equation}

where $L$ is the length of the trajectory. The strong magnetic field provided by the solenoid 
and the high spatial resolution of the tracker detectors, allows CMS to have 
a very good momentum resolution; for instance, the momentum resolution for muons 
is 1$\%$ up to 100 GeV \cite{chp2:CMSTDR2}.\\

%Figure  shows the 
%trajectories for several particles in the solenoid magnetic field.

 \end{figure}

The CMS superconducting solenoid is the biggest one built ever. The coil is made of NbTi with 4 layers of winding. In order to 
generate the strong magnetic field, this solenoid operates
with a nominal current of 19.5 kA, storing an energy up to 2.6 GJ. A cooling system
keeps its superconducting state using liquid helium at 4.65 K. The 
main parameters of the CMS magnet are summarized in Table \ref{tablechp2:Solenoid}.

\section{The Tracker System}
\label{sec:Tracker}

The Tracker System is the inner-most detector system in CMS. This system has 
a cylindrical shape covering an acceptance range of $|\eta| < $ 2.5. This system is 
designed to reconstruct accurately the charged-particle tracks, which is essential 
for achieving a high momentum resolution as well as for identifying the primary and the 
secondary vertices. Secondary vertices are the evidence of the decay 
of long-lived particles coming out the collision, for instance 
jets originated b-decays, known as \textit{b-jets}, which have a vertex 
that can be distinguished from the primary vertex. Therefore 
a high resolution of secondary vertex reconstruction is required in order to 
identify b-jet (See section \ref{sec:bJet}). In this dissertation the 
Tracker System is crucial due to the following reasons:

%for the 
%The Tracker System, 
%besides the identification of primary vertex and the reconstruction of 
%charged-hadron tracks, is important in this dissertation for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The searches for heavy resonances in the di-lepton channels require a 
 high momentum resolution for leptons with transverse momentum greater than 1 TeV. 
 \item Since the tau-leptons can decay into charged hadrons (see section \ref{sec:Taus}), the 
 reconstruction of these hadron in the Tracker System is crucial
 for the tau identification and reconstruction and for its momentum resolution. Charged
 hadrons are reconstructed with an efficiency of at least 95$\%$ for \pt~greater than
 10 GeV (see section \ref{subsec:TrackReco}) \cite{TrackerPerformace}.
 \item The transverse impact parameter and secondary-vertex resolution are comparable with 
 the distances that tau-leptons travel before decay \cite{TauReconstructionCMSRun1}; 
 in consequence, there is a probability that a b-jet can fake 
 the tau signature \textcolor{red}{REFERENCIA A LA SECCION DONDE SE HABLA DE B-JET BACKGROUND}. The 
 high b-jet identification efficiency provided by the Tracker System will reduce this source of background.
 \item Due to the material of the Tracker System, there is a high probability 
 that photons coming from $\pi^{0} \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ convert into electron-positron 
 pairs. The interaction of these photons with the Tracker material is important for jet and tau reconstruction,
 since $\pi^{0}$'s are copiously produced in QCD jets and they are also one of the tau decay 
 products (see section \ref{sec:Taus}).
 %performance of their reconstruction in the Tracker System 
%Since tau-lepton decays on charged hadrons (see section \ref{sec:Taus}), 
 %The tau reconstruction performance and its momentum resolution depend on 
 
 % which is important for the tau reconstruction since, as 
% mentioned in section \ref{sec:Taus}, $\pi^{0}$ is one of the tau decay products.
\end{itemize}

Since the Tracker System is the closest detector to the interaction point, it is exposed 
to the highest radiation doses in CMS; in average 1000 particles from 27 proton-proton collision 
are passing through this system each 25 ns. In consequence, the Tracker System was designed to achieve a high granularity 
and a fast response in order to identify the tracks and associate them 
to the proper BX. This system was designed to have a high level of radiation hardness. Since 
these requirements are fulfilled by silicon detectors, the Tracker System is based on 
this technology. This system is composed of two subsystems: the Pixel Tracker and the Strip Tracker. \\ 

%\subsection{Pixel Tracker}
%\label{subsec:Pixel}

\textbf{The Pixel Tracker}\\

The Pixel Tracker is the closest subsystem to the beam pipe. It is 
composed by three concentric layers with a radius of 4,4 cm, 7,3 cm and 10,2 cm, and each one has a lenght of 53 cm. In 
the forward regions, there are two disks in each endcap which are located at $|z|$ = 34.5 cm and $|z|$ =  46,5 cm from 
the interaction point (See Figure \ref{figchp2:Tracker}). The whole subsystem has 
approximately 66 million pixels, covering an active surface area of around
one squared meter. Each pixel cell has a size of 100$\times$150 $\mu$m$^{2}$, providing a high 
spacial resolution in the $r-\phi$ plane and also in the $z$ directions. The Pixel detector has 
an acceptance range of $|\eta| < 2.5$.

\textcolor{red}{REFERECIA PIXEL}
%In summary, the Pixel detector provides three accurate points in an acceptance range of $|\eta| < 2.5$, mainly 
%used for vertices reconstruction. \\

\textbf{The Strip Tracker} \\

Surrounding the Pixel Tracker is the Strip Tracker, which is made of 9.6 million strips sensors,
covering an active detection area of 198 m$^{2}$. This subsystem is divided in two 
components: the inner tracker (20 cm $< |z| <$ 55 cm) and the outer 
tracker (55 cm $< |z| <$ 116 cm). The inner tracker
is made of 4 cylindrical layers, called \textit{Tracker Inner Barrel} (TIB), and 3 discs
installed in each endcap, known as \textit{Tracker Inner Disks} (TID). The outer tracker
is composed of 6 layers, called \textit{Tracker Outer Barrel} (TOB), and 9 discs in each 
endcap, known as \textit{Tracker End Cap} (TEC). The whole Strip Tracker has 
a diameter of 2.4 m and a length of 5.5 m, covering an acceptance range 
of $|\eta| < 2.5$ (See Figure \ref{figchp2:Tracker}). The spatial resolution depends 
on the location of each strip sensor within the subsystem, for instance, the spatial 
resolution provided by the TIB which varies from 23 to 34 $\mu$m in the $r-\phi$ plane and 23 $\mu$m in 
the $z$ direction. \\

\textbf{Particle interaction with the Tracker material} \\

When a particle passes through the Tracker System it interacts not only with the active volume
of the detector, but also with the other components such as the read-out electronic, 
the mechanical structure, the services and the cooling system. This amount material is significant
and the interaction with the crossing particles must be considered. Figure \ref{figchp2:Tracker_TrackerMaterial}
shows the thickness (in terms of number of radiation lengths) of tracker material that a particle must 
pass through before reaching the ECAL. As a result, there is a high probability that 
photons, coming from $\pi^{0} \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$, can convert into electron-positron 
pairs which, as mentioned above, is important for jet and tau reconstruction.

\section{Calorimeter System}

The purpose of the Calorimeter System is to ``stop'' most of the particles 
coming out from the collision and to measure their energy with a good 
granularity. Electrons, photons, and hadrons interact with the calorimeter 
material and deposit all their energy on the detectors allowing their energy 
to be measured. The only SM particles that scape from the Calorimeter System are 
muons and neutrinos: muons deposit a very low amount of their energy on the 
calorimeters and therefore, in order to identify them there are additional 
detectors installed in the outer side of CMS; in case of neutrinos, since they 
only interacts weakly, they escape without detection, leading an energy 
imbalance in the event, then, the information of the energy imbalance 
is an indirect evidence that a weakly-interacting particles such 
as neutrinos \footnote{A big amount of energy 
imbalance would be a evidence of dark matter candidates}. \\

The CMS Calorimeter is divided in two subsystems: the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and 
the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). The ECAL is the closest calorimeter subsystem to the interaction point, 
designed to measure the energy of electrons and photons. The reconstruction of photons and 
electrons are essential for many physics analyses, for instance for those analyses which 
jets or taus are involved; for these analyses, the photon and electron 
reconstruction are crucial for the energy measurement of the jet and for 
the tau identification: a jet contains a copious amount of 
neutral pions which most of the times decays into one photon pair; since
these photons might convert into electron-positron, the electron and 
photon reconstruction is important for the energy measurement of the jet. Similarly, their
reconstruction is important for tau identification since neutral pions are one of the decay 
products of the tau-lepton. The HCAL, the other calorimeter subsystem, is designed to measure the energy of the 
hadrons. Figure \ref{figchp2:CMStrajectories} shows the arrangement of the 
calorimeters in CMS and the energy deposits of SM particles on them.





%because photons, that come from $\pi^{0}$ 
%decays ($\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$), can convert into electron-positron pair; therefore, their 
%reconstruction is important for jet and tau identification, considering that $\pi^{0}$'s are produced copiously in 
%QCD jets and they are one of the tau decay products.

%since they are heavy lepton, and come out from the whole CMS detector, 
%while neutrinos scape from CMS without detection since it only interacts weakly. 


\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
\label{subsec:ECal}


The electromagnetic calorimeter is designed to absorb the total energy 
of electrons, positrons, and photons when they pass through it. The interaction between these 
particles and the calorimeter material produces a cascade of electrons, positrons, and photons in a process 
called electromagnetic showers. Electromagnetic showers start when an energetic electron, 
positron or photon enters to the high density material of the calorimeter. Electrons and 
positrons losses their energy by bremsstrahlung, while photons 
losses their energy by electron-positron conversions. Therefore, a cascade
of secondary particles is created and the energy losses continue through 
these two processes (pair production and bremsstrahlung) until the energy of photons is not
enough for pair production and the energy losses of electrons are dominated by other processes 
than bremsstrahlung; then, the energy of the products of the electromagnetic cascade 
is measured using scintillators. As a result, the energy 
deposits of the electromagnetic shower are spread on the calorimeter material, and 
their energy profile (transverse and longitudinal) is needed to determinate 
the initial energy of the particle. Electromagnetic showers are then described by two parameters which depend
on the calorimeter material: the radiation length (X$_{0}$) and the Moliere radius. The radiation length is 
the distance than an electron or photon travels until its energy is reduced by a factor 
of $1/e$, while the Moliere radius is the radius of a cylinder where 90$\%$ of 
the electromagnetic shower is contained. In consequence, the calorimeter 
is designed with a enough thickness (in terms of radiation length) to measure the total
energy of the particles, and with a Moliere radius small enough to achieve a good granularity. 
The schematic view of an electromagnetic shower is shown in Figure \ref{figchp2:EMshower}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figuras/Chapter2/EMshower}
      \caption{Electromagnetic shower
      } \label{figchp2:EMshower}
    \end{center}
 \end{figure}

The ECAL is a hermetic and cylindrical calorimeter whose scintillators are made of 
lead tungstate crystals (PbWO$_{4}$) shown in Figure \ref{figchp2:ECALcrytal}. The PbWO$_{4}$ crystals has a 
high density (8.28 $g/cm^{3}$), short radiation length (0.89 cm) and 
small Moliere radius (2.2 cm), making them appropriate to achieve 
accurate energy measurements with a good granularity \cite{chp2:CMS}; additionally 
these crystals have a fast response and a high radiation endurance, proper for the LHC environment. When 
these crystals are transversed by electrons or photons, they emit a light pulse 
with a time response of $\sim$25 ns (about 80$\%$ of the times); the scintillator
light is collected by photo-detectors that convert it into an electric signal. The 
photo-detectors used are Avalanche Photo-Diodes (APDs) in the barrel and Vacuum Photo-Triodes 
(VPT) in the endcaps. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figuras/Chapter2/ECALcrytal.jpg}
      \caption{ CMS ECAL Lead Tungstate Crystals (PbWO$_{4}$)
      } \label{figchp2:ECALcrytal}
    \end{center}
 \end{figure}
 
The ECAL has 61200 crystals in the barrel and 7324 crystals in each endcap \cite{CMSTDRcap4}, covering a 
$|\eta|$ range up to 3. The crystals are installed in a quasi-projective geometry 
in such a way that each crystal points toward the center of the detector with an additional angle 
of 3$^{\circ}$ with respect to this direction \footnote{In the case of the endcaps, this angle 
varies from 2$^{\circ}$  to 8$^{\circ}$}; the purpose of this 
geometrical arrangement is to avoid particles pass through inactive regions of the ECAL. In the 
barrel region, the calorimeter (ECAL Barrel or EB) has a inner radius of 129 cm, covering a 
pseudorapidity region of $|\eta| < $1.479. The EB crystals are 230 mm long (25.8 $X_{0}$) and 
covers a cross-section at the front face of 0.0174 $\times$ 0.0174 
in the $\eta-\phi$ plane ($22\times22$ mm$^{2}$). In the forward region,
the ECAL (ECAL Endcaps or EE) is located to 314 cm from the collision point, covering 
1,479 $ < |\eta| < $ 3,0. The EE crystals are 220 mm long (24.7 $X_{0}$) and cover
a cross-section of 28.62$\times$ 28.62 mm$^{2}$. In addition to the crystals, Preshower 
Detectors are installed in the endcaps, covering a pseudorapidity range of  $1.65<|\eta|<2.6$. This detector consists of two 
lead layers, each one followed by silicon sensors. Their main goal is 
to identify the two photons produced by neutral-pion decays 
in the forward region. The whole ECAL arrangement is shown in Figure \ref{figchp2:ECALcrytal}

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{figuras/Chapter2/ECAL.pdf}
\caption{Arrangement of the ECAL components}\label{figchp2:ECALcrytal}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

The energy resolution reached by the ECAL is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{ECALenergyResolution}
 \left(\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}\right)^{2} = \left(\frac{2.8\%}{\sqrt{E}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{0.12\%}{E}\right)^{2} + \left(0.3\% \right)^{2}\quad, 
\end{equation}

where 2.8$\%$ relies on the stochastic term due to electromagnetic showers, 12 $\%$ comes from the 
electronic noise and 0.3$\%$ refers to the systematic uncertainty produced by the calibration of the apparatus. As can be inferred from
Eq. \ref{ECALenergyResolution}, the energy resolution for energetic particles is dominated by the systematic uncertainty, while
the stochastic and noise terms are dominant for low energies. As an example, the energy resolution 
obtained in the EB is close to 1$\%$ for all electrons that come from Z decays \cite{ECALperformance}.

\subsection{Hadronic Calorimeter}
\label{subsec:HCal}

The Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) is designed to stop the hadrons and to measure 
their energy. It is composed of fluorescent scintillators inserted in layers of 
a dense material called the absorber. The absorber is made of stainless 
steel and copper layers. When a hadron hits the absorber it produces a cascade of 
particles, known as a hadronic shower. The hadronic shower is a cascade of 
secondary particles, mainly pions, originated by strong interactions between 
the hadron and the atomic nuclei of the absorber material.  Due to the copious pion
production, electromagnetic showers are also involved because of the 
neutral pion decays. As the hadronic shower develops, the particles are detected by the scintillator, which
 produces light pulses when a particle passes through it; then the light pulses are 
 collected by optical fibers. The amount of light collected is proportional to the amount 
 of energy deposited in the scintillator material, allowing their energy to be measured. A hadronic 
 shower is described by the absorption length, which is the average distance traveled by the 
 hadron trough the medium before it strongly-interacts with the absorber; it is given by:

 \begin{equation}
 \lambda = \frac{A}{N_{A} \sigma_{abs}} \quad,
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the nuclei weight, $N_{A}$ is the Avogadro's number and $\sigma_{abs}$
is the absorption cross-section.\\

The HCAL arranged in the central pseudorapidity region, or 
HCAL Barrel (HB), is radially restricted since it is placed in the remaining volume
between the ECAL and the solenoid; for this reason, the Hadron Outer Calorimeter (HO) is 
installed outside the solenoid in order to improve its hermiticity. In the 
forward region, there are two subsystems installed: the HCAL Endcap (HE) 
which covers the pseudorapidity range acceptance of $\eta <$ 3, and the HCAL 
Forward (HF) which extends the $\eta$ coverage of the calorimeter up to 5.2. The HCAL structure 
is shown in Figure \ref{figchp2:HCAL}.

%3$ < |\eta| < $5.2.


\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figuras/Chapter2/HCAL1}
\caption{Disposition of the HCAL components.}\label{figchp2:HCAL}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

The HB is divided into two identical halves in the $z$-direction. Each half is composed of 18
wedges, covering a range of $|\eta| < $ 1.4. Each wedge consists of brass absorber plates 
staggered with plastic scintillators. The absorber material is made of brass 
because it is a non-magnetic material and it has a small 
radiation length ($\lambda = $ 16.42 cm), making it appropriate for the CMS environment. Between every
two layers of absorbers, there is installed a plastic scintillator with a thickness of 3,7 mm; they send 
the light pulse through optical-fibers (WaveLenght Shifter, WLS) to reach the 
photo-detectors (Hibryd Photodiode, HPD). The photo-detectors convert the light pulse 
into the electric signal. The innermost and 
outermost plates of the wedge are made of stainless steel in order to strengthen the structure. Each wedge 
is segmented in the $\eta$-direction by 16 structures called towers; each tower 
covers an identical solid angle whose area in the $\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta$ plane is 0,087$\times$0,087. \\

The HO is located outside the solenoid, covering $|\eta| < $ 1.26. It uses as absorber 
material the solenoid itself and the most inner layer of the 
iron-yoke structure. The HO is divided into
5 wheels in the $z$-direction, similar to the geometrical disposition 
of the Muon Chambers (see section \ref{sec:MuonSys}). In the central wheel of the detector, there 
are two layers of plastic scintillators staggered with the solenoid and the inner 
layer of the iron yoke. Additionally, there is one scintillator installed i
n each remaining wheel just behind the solenoid. The Figure \ref{figchp2:HCAL} shows the disposition of 
the HO plastic scintillators. \\

In the forward region, the HE is installed just behind the EE, covering 
1.4 $ < |\eta| <$ 3. The HE is a sampling detector, similarly than the HB, which 
is composed of brass layers staggered with plastic scintillators of 3.7 mm of 
thickness. The HF is located to 11.2 m from the interacting point in the $z$-direction,
covering an extended $\eta$ region up to 5. The purpose of 
the HF is to achieve a better hermiticity, which improves 
the reconstruction of very forward jets as well as 
the measurement of the energy imbalance in an event. \\

Due to the nature of a sampling detector as the HCAL, its energy resolution 
is worse than the one obtained by the ECAL \cite{chp2:CMS}. For example, the energy
resolution for pions is given by:

\begin{equation} \label{ECALenergyResolution}
 \left(\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}\right)^{2} = \left(\frac{138\%}{\sqrt{E}}\right)^{2} + \left(13\% \right)^{2}\quad, 
\end{equation}

Although the HCAL does not provide a high energy resolution, it is not crucial
since the energy resolution is improved combining the information obtained by the HCAL
with the other detector systems. 

\section{The Muon System}
\label{sec:MuonSys}

The purpose of the Muon System is beside of the muon 
identification and its momentum measurement, trigger with them because
their presence might indicate interesting physics. The Muon System
is located outside the solenoid, since the muons are the only known charged particles 
than can transverse the tracker, the calorimeters and the solenoid. In order to achieve these
goals, CMS has three different kinds of Muon Detectors: Drift Tubes (DTs), Cathode Strip 
Chambers (CSCs) and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs). The DTs and the CSCs are used for 
tracking the muon signature and for measuring its momentum; they are placed in the barrel
and the endcaps, respectively. The RPCs are used for triggering due to their high time 
resolution; they are used in both the barrel and the endcaps. During LS2, Gas 
Electron Multipliers (GEMs) will be installed in the endcaps in order to improve the muon identification efficiency and
the momentum measurement resolution in these regions. In addition to their high granularity, GEMs will be used for triggering,
due to their high time resolution. The Muon System structure, including GEM detectors, is 
shown in Figure \ref{figchp2:MuonSystem}.\\

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figuras/Chapter2/MuonSystem}
\caption{Longitudinal view of CMS, showing the Muon System layout: DT Detectors are represented in pink,
CSCs are green and RPCs are blue. GEM Detectors, that will be installed in LS2, are in red.}\label{figchp2:MuonSystem}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

In the barrel region, the Muon Chambers (DTs and RPCs) are inserted into the 
five wheels of the iron yoke, forming four concentric cylindrical layers in order
to reconstruct the signature of the muon. Each concentric layer is divided
in 12 sectors. Then, the geometrical arrangement of the Muon System consists on 
5 wheels in the $z$-direction, 4 layers in the $r-$direction and 12 sectors
in the $\phi-$direction. In the forward region, the Muon Chambers (CSCs and RPCs)
are arranged in each endcap into 4 discs, where each disk is divided into 
12 sectors in the $\phi-$direction and 4 rings in the $r-$direction. \\

The geometrical disposition of the Muon Chambers, the DTs and the RPCs in the barrel system, and 
the CSCs and the RPCs in the endcap, composes a complementary system which provides
two independent sources of information in each region, which improves 
muon reconstruction efficiency. The RPCs provides a fast response ($<$ 25 ns), allowing 
the BX identification of the muon track, without ambiguity; while 
DTs and CSCs provides a accurately spatial resolution, providing an accurate energy 
and momentum resolution. The information obtained from the Muon Chambers
are combined with the one provided by the Tracker system in order to 
improve the muon identification efficiency and the muon reconstruction. For instance,
the momentum resolution for muons of \pt~$= 10$ GeV is 10$\%$ using only the information
provided by Muon Chambers, while it decreases up to 1$\%$ combining their information with 
the one obtained from the Tracker System \cite{chp2:CMSTDR}.
