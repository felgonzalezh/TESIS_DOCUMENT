Our understanding of the behavior of elementary particles and their interactions is 
currently described by the Standard Model (SM). Nevertheless, there are still open 
questions in particle physics that are not addressed by this model. For instance: the SM does 
not provide an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry; it does not 
explain the origin of the neutrino's masses, as well as the 
neutrino oscillations; besides, the SM does not explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy;
it does not include a quantum version of gravity; among others. For these reasons, 
many theories, known as Beyond Standard Model (BSM) \cite{BSM} theories, have been proposed.
Most of them extend the SM symmetry group in order to address the open questions. \\

One of the simplest ways of extending the SM symmetry is through an additional
U(1)$^{\prime}$ group. This symmetry would give rise to the existence of a 
new neutral gauge boson, generically referred as \Zprime. These kind of models were initially 
motivated by the SM electroweak symmetry breaking, since it leaves the U(1)$_{\text{EM}}$ group as a remnant. In a similar way, breaking 
an extended SM symmetry could resort in an extra U(1)$^{\prime}$ symmetry group. Other 
important motivation to include an additional U(1)$^{\prime}$ symmetry and its associated 
\Zprime~ comes from the Grand Unification Theories (GUT), especially those 
based on the groups: SU(5), SO(10) or E$_6$. (CORREGIR Y ENTENDER ESTA FRASE) In some Super 
String and Super Symmetry (SUSY) models, the U(1)$^{\prime}$ symmetry is 
below the GUT scale, and its symmetry breaking usually 
involves with soft super symmetry breaking scale. 
In these scenarios the \Zprime~boson would have a mass in the TeV range and, consequently, if it exists it
could be produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN \cite{Langacker:2008yv}. Therefore, additional to
the excitement of a new gauge boson discovery, the existence of a \Zprime~would stand for a clear 
evidence of Physics Beyond SM, which could come from scenarios of Supersymmetry or Superstring Models. \\
  
The discovery of a massive \Zprime~boson would have profound implications due to the nature of 
the \Uprime~symmetry breaking, since it would require an extended Higgs sector and, in the case 
of SUSY scenarios, it would also require an extended neutralino sector\cite{Langacker:2008yv}. 
This would have consequences for particle physics and for cosmology relared with the dark matter problem. In some scenarios
the \Zprime~would have family-dependent charges, which would lead to Flavor-Changing Neutral Current 
contributions (FCNC)\cite{Langacker:2008yv}. Therefore, the \Zprime~discovery would also have implications for 
the neutrino mass problem, for the nature of the SUSY hidden sector and for the possible 
mediator(s) of SUSY breaking. On the other hand, there are many BSM models which attempt to 
solve the problem of quadratic divergencies for  the Higgs mass through an extra U(1)$'$ symmetry, 
for example models with \emph{Little Higgs} \cite{Langacker:2008yv}. The \emph{Little Higgs} models would
can produce in new Higgs in the TeV energy scale as well as one or more \Zprime~bosons.\\

Because of the \Zprime~bosons are predicted at TeV scales and they would couple to the SM fermions, 
these hypothetical particles would be produced in the proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The \Zprime~ 
signature would be reflected as a heavy resonance in the invariant mass distribution of its 
decay products: opposite-charged fermions (i.e. high momentum leptons or jets coming from $q\bar{b}$ quarks). During 
the last two decades, the evidence of a \Zprime~boson has been excluded by several searches. 
The CDF\cite{CDFZprimedielectronbib,CDFZprimedimuonbib,CDFZprimeditaubib,CDFZprimeditopbib}  
and D0\cite{D0Zprimesearchesbib,D0Zprimetodielectronbib,D0Zprimeditopbib} experiments at the Tevatron, and
the CMS\cite{CMSZprime2dileptonbib,CMSZprime2ditaubib,CMSZprime2tausRunII,CMSZprime2ditauelectronmuonbib,CMSZprime2toptop,CMSZprime2bbbib,CMSZprime2dijetbib}
and ATLAS \cite{ATLASZprime2dileptonbib,ATLASZprime2ditaubib,ATLASZprime2toptopbib, ATLAS_Zprime2tausRunII} experiments at the LHC, have 
constrained the existence of \Zprime~bosons in a wide range of mass. The tightest 
upper limits on the \Zprime~mass have been set by the CMS and ATLAS experiments in the dilepton final 
state (Z$'\rightarrow \ell\ell$, where $\ell=e, \mu$), where the \Zprime~has been excluded below 3.2 TeV (CMS) and 3.4 TeV (ATLAS)
for the simples model. These searches were performed with the data collected by the experiments during 2015, for proton-proton 
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV \cite{CMSZprime2dileptonbib,ATLASZprime2dileptonbib}. The channels
where the \Zprime~decays into a light lepton pairs ($ee$ and $\mu\mu$ final states) have been explored
widely due to their high mass resolution, large acceptance and relative low background. The most significative 
background in the dilepton channels comes from Drell-Yan (DY) processes, which have been studied extensively. This 
background has the same topology as the hypothetical \Zprime~events, but it can be largely 
suppressed since its reconstructed mass lays mainly around the Z boson mass. Nevertheless, the 
reconstructed mass distribution of DY+jets events has a long tail extending to large values, which 
makes them an important and irreducible background for \Zprime~searches.  \\

In the \Zprime~searches the theoretical model generally used as a benchmark is the Sequential Standard Model (SSM). (REFERENCIA)
This is the simplest model since, in it the \Zprime~boson obeys the 
universality of the SM couplings; it has the same couplings than the SM $Z^{0}$ gauge boson. Nevertheless, there are 
also many BSM scenarios that predict a generational coupling dependence, where the \Zprime~boson 
would decay preferentially to the third generation of fermions. For instance, 
the topcolor-assisted technicolor (TAT) models, which attempt to give an explanation to the high mass of the top quark,
predict a heavy gauge boson Z$^{\prime}_{\text{TAT}}$ with enhanced couplings to the third generation \cite{Langacker:2008yv}. These models 
are an especial compelling motivation to search for \Zprime~bosons decaying into tau pairs, which is the main goal of this PhD 
thesis. Consequently, if a resonance were found in the other fermion-pair final states (such as $\ell\ell$), the search for 
\Zprimetotautau would be very important since it would confirm or it would discard 
the hypothesis of the universality of the couplings. \\

The experimental signature of the \Zprimetotautau~channel consists on events with high $p_{T}$, almost
back-to-back and oppositely charged $\tau$-pairs. The search for \Zprime~decaying into tau-pairs 
usually involves four experimental signatures, since the $\tau$ lepton has different decay modes: it 
can decay leptonically into a lighter lepton and two neutrinos (we will refer to the taus that decay in 
this way as \taue~or \taumu, depending on the lepton in which they decay); 
or it can decay hadronically into a set of pions and a neutrino (we will refer to the taus that decay in this form
as \tauh). Therefore, the search for \Zprimetotautau includes 
the channels: \taue\tauh~, \taumu\tauh~, \taue\taumu~and \tauh\tauh~. The \taue\taue~and \taumu\taumu~channels
have not been included in the search due to their relative low branching ratio, and because of the difficulty to
distinguish their signature from the dilepton channels (\Zprime$\rightarrow \mu\mu$, \Zprime$\rightarrow ee$). The $\tau$ 
identification represents an important experimental challenge for several reasons: first, since 
the $\tau$ can not be reconstructed fully due to neutrinos, the momentum can not be known; additionally, the leptonic decay of 
the tau can not be identified since it has the same signature than events in which leptons were produced as a result of 
a collision; and finally, the hadronic decay has a similiar signature to a QCD jet. Therefore, sofisticated tau 
identification algorithms have been developed by CMS and ATLAS experiments in order improve the identification 
efficiency. The CMS experiment uses the Hadron Plus Strips (HPS) algorithm, that 
identifies the hadronic tau leptons with an efficiency of 60 $\%$. Therefore, the difficulty of the tau 
identification, makes the search of \Zprimetotautau challenging. \\

The \Zprime$\rightarrow$\tauell\tauh~are the most sensitive channels since they have 
a relative high yield, a better acceptance due to the presence of light leptons, and a relatively
low QCD background. The \Zprimetotauh~channel has the highest 
expected yield but it also has a very high background coming 
from QCD multijet production. The purpose of this thesis is to search for \Zprime~bosons decaying into two hadronic taus 
in proton-proton collision at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, with the data collected by the 
CMS  experiment during 2016. In the CMS collaboration, the \Zprime searches 
are managed by the Exotic group, meanwhile the searches for \Zprimetotautau have 
being performed by the BSM3G Group, which I have been collaborating from 2015. (MEJOR DESCRIPCION DE ESTO, LOS GRUPOS DE CERN)\\

%, making interesting this channel from the experimental point of view. 

During the Run I at the LHC, the CMS and ATLAS experiments performed searches for heavy resonances 
in the ditau final states, using the combined channels mentioned above \cite{CMSZprime2ditaubib,ATLASZprime2ditaubib}.
CMS has excluded the \ZprimeSSM for masses below 1.4 TeV, using data collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$7 TeV; while ATLAS 
has set an exclusion limit for the \ZprimeSSM mass of 2.02 TeV, using data at collisions $\sqrt{s}=$8 TeV. 
CMS Collaboration has also carried out a search for a \Zprime$\rightarrow$\taue\taumu boson, using collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$8 TeV, excluding
the \ZprimeSSM for masses below 1.3 TeV \cite{CMSZprime2ditauelectronmuonbib}. With the high luminosity and the new energy range 
reached by the LHC during Run II, CMS has performed also the \Zprimetotautau search at $\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV using the 2015 data, and reporting 
%a new upper limit of 1.7 TeV for the \ZprimeSSM~mass \cite{CMS_Zprime2tays2015}. On the other hand, ATLAS experiment
a new upper limit of 2.1 TeV for the \ZprimeSSM~mass \cite{CMSZprime2tausRunII}. The higher luminosity reached 
by the LHC during 2016 made possible a improved search. This document presents this search, using 
the data collected by the CMS experiment during 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. REGRESAR AL FINAL A PONER LOS RESULTADOS\\
%We expect to exclude the \ZprimeSSM~boson decaying into two hadronic taus for masses 
%below 2.7 TeV, but combining this result with the remaining ditau channel analysis (performed by the other members of the BSM3G group)
%we expect to exclude it for masses below of 3.0 TeV. The combined result improves the sensitivite of the previous search. \\


This document is organized as follows: in Chapter \ref{chap:Zp} I will present the theoretical bases of physics of 
the \Zprime~boson, presenting the most relevant models as well as the results for previous searches. In 
Chapter \ref{chap:CMSExp}, all CMS experiment will be described. I will start with a brief description 
of the LHC, and afterwards a full description of the CMS detector and its subdetectors, making emphasis 
in the tau detection. Since the tau identification is crucial in order to distinguish the \Zprime events, in Chapter \ref{chap:ParticleID}
I present in the Chapter  a detailed description of the physics objects reconstruction algorithms used
by CMS collaboration, focusing mainly in tau algorithms. All the experimental techniques involved in the 
identification of the \Zprimetotauh~signature are presented in Chapter \ref{chap:AnalysisStrategy}. 
I discuss all the backgrounds for this channel and explain the all techniques that I have developed 
to estimate them. Finally, the results of the search and discussions about additional studies performed to identify the \Zprime 
are presented in the Chapter \ref{chap:Analysis}.


%Although, the signature of a \Zprime would be a heavy resonance in the invariant mass distribution, and in consequence the experimental 
%search of this particles is model-independent, the
