There are still open questions in particle physics that the Standard Model (SM) does 
not provide explenations; for instance, 

the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the nature of the dark matter and dark energy,
the origin of neutrino masses and their oscilations.

Our understanding of the behavior of the elementary particles and the interactions between them is 
currently summarized by the Standard Model (SM). Nevertheless, there are still open 
questions in particle physics that are not addressed by the SM; for instance, SM does 
not provide an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the origin of nuetrino's masses as well as the 
neutrino oscilations, besides it does not predict the nature of dark matter and dark energy,
and it does not include the a quantum version of gravity among others. For these reasons, many theories has been proposed 
in order to address the deficiencies of the SM, these theories are known as Beyond Standard Mmodel (BMS).

although SM has been consolidated experimentally during the last two decades, 




Although the SM has been consolidated with the Higgs boson discovery, there are several reasons
to consider that this model does not represent a complete description of nature; for instance: the SM
does not provide any explanation for the dark matter; 
neither it makes any predictions on the nature of the dark energy observed by the astronomers; 
it does not include a quantum version of gravity; it does
not explain the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in the universe; and it does not explain
the origin of the mass of the neutrinos. Many theories have been proposed to extend the SM and to try
to address these questions by extending the SM symmetry group, in what is known as theories beyond
the Standard Model (BSM) [13].

the ones that include extra U(1)$'$
symmetries are very common and important.  The extra symmetries would result in new
neutral gauge bosons, generically called Z$'$. The main reason for studying these kinds
of extensions of the SM has to do with the mathematical fact that in the reduction of larger
symmetries, for example throught spontaneous symmetry breaking, the remaining symmetry always includes
at least one U(1) group.  One example of this is the electroweak symmetry breaking of the SM, that leaves
the unbroken group U(1)$_{\text{EM}}$.

Inspired by the SM, the best motivated models consists in include and additional U(1) group, which 
has an associated gauge boson knons as \Zprime

that explains 


Inspite of the consistency of the Standard Model of Particles (SM), it has still open questions. 



This extended symmetry group would lead an associated gauge boson, usually known as 
\Zprime. 

The discovery of the \Zprime would leave important implications, not only the discovery of the new boson it self,
but also the bascis of Physics of Beyond Stardar Model (BSM).
